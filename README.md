# Getting Started with higher level programming
---
For the past three months, or four considering that I hade to defer. I have been learning 
software engineering concepts using the C programming language as the main language of instruction.
After conquering the `gates of shell` I begin my `python hello world` project today.

---
If you go through the **alx system engineering deveops** and **alx low level programming** you would notice an
improvement in my mark down files or should I say documentations.

---
I am on a software engineering career journey and I am loving every path of it, the segmentation faults or other
program errors tooðŸ˜Š
