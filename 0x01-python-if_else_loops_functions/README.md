## TASKS
And just like in previous projects and tasks, I am to come up with the solutions for the tasks below
myself so I can meet up with the above learning objectives

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
1. The last digit
2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
4. Hexadecimal Printing
5. 00..99
6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
7. islower
8. To uppercase
9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
10. a + b
11. a ^ b
12. Fizz Buzz
13. Insert in sorted linked list

I normally would have given a brief description of each of the task but, I am trying to conserve every-time
I can because I simultaneously studying Electrical Engineering and I have semester exams comming up.

There are 3 advanced task that I would unlock if I am able to finish up the mandatory task.
Sincerely, I rarely complete the advanced task because it is either my thought capacity or I don't want
to spend the time thinking about it.
